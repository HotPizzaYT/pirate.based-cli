# pirate.based-cli
A CLI version of pirate.based with way more features!
- Proxy + alternative server options
- Actually has trackers included with the magnet link!
# Cons
- Linux only. I will work on a Powershell version soon when I get my VM up and running
- Torrent downloading is not embedded into the program.
- Currently, there are no API mirror sites, or any that I've heard of
- Because of the above, no API mirror sites have been tested.
